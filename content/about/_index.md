title: Who Am I
---


I studied my B.Sc. in *Language and Hispanic Literature* at the *Faculty of Philosophy* in the **Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)**. Currently, I am about to graduate from my master in Sciences in the field of *Computational Modelling and Scientific Computation (MCCC)* at the **Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos (UAEM)**. 

I actively collaborate with the **Psycholinguistic Lab**, Faculty of Psychology, UNAM, and the **Cognitive and Language Development Lab**, Faculty of Psychology, UNAM. Currently, I am a member of the **Cognitive Robotics Lab**, UAEM where I studied *language multimodal perception* and the emergence of the McGurk Effect.

My research interest includes **Language Perception**, **Language Acquisition**, **Language Development**, **Embodied Cognition**, **Developmental Robotics**, and **Cognitive Modelling**. I am especially interested in General Domain mechanisms as *self-organization* and *statistical learning* as operational mechanisms to explain both language and cognition in children and adults.
